## What I learned
- Pseudo-classes style elements by state: :hover, :focus, :nth-child(), :first-child
- transition on the base element makes style changes animate smoothly
- CSS variables: define with name: value on :root

- Variables make updating a color scheme a one-line change
- <img> is inline by default — set display: block before margin: 0 auto to center it
- CSS Diner: good practice for combinators and class selectors

## Challenges
- transition goes on the base state, not hover — otherwise it only animates one direction
- CSS Diner got hard fast once it hit :nth-of-type() where I had to add 2n+3 etc and combinators

## AI usage
tried incorporating openclaw with my codes

## Questions
- When is a CSS variable worth naming vs. just repeating the value?
- What else can transform do beyond translate?
